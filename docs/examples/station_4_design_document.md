# Station 4 Design Document

## Station Title
**Station 4: From Logic to Computational Thinking**

---

## Station Purpose

Station 4 exists to **name and frame the kind of thinking HAP has already been practicing** in Stations 1–3. This station does not introduce new mechanics, syntax, or problem-solving techniques. Instead, it provides a conceptual lens that helps HAP (and observing students) understand *why* the earlier work mattered and *how* developers think when problems become more complex.

This station marks a deliberate shift from **doing** to **understanding the doing**.

---

## Pedagogical Goals

By the end of Station 4, students should:

- Recognize that logical correctness is necessary but insufficient for real-world problem solving
- Understand computational thinking as a way of thinking and communicating, not as a programming skill
- See that they have already practiced computational thinking implicitly
- Gain shared vocabulary (the Four Pillars) without being expected to master or apply it yet
- Be motivated to document reasoning in Station 5

---

## Narrative Role in the Learning Lab

Station 4 functions as a **conceptual consolidation point**.

- Stations 1–3: lived experience, trial, correction
- Station 4: naming and framing that experience
- Station 5: preserving and communicating reasoning

This station prevents later learning from feeling arbitrary by giving students a mental map of what they have already done.

---

## Character Roles

### HAP

- Curious and ambitious
- No longer confused about the game itself
- Wants to build "real" things beyond the current example
- Begins to sense that a different kind of thinking is required

HAP does **not** teach, prompt, or explain to students. All learning occurs through observation of HAP’s realizations.

---

### Grace Hopper

- Observational and declarative
- Introduces the term *computational thinking* without explaining it
- Sets a boundary between logical thinking and what will be required next
- Motivates the station by linking ambition to the need for a stronger thinking framework

Grace does not enumerate the pillars or define them.

---

### Prof. Teeters

- Acts as a facilitator, not a lecturer
- Bridges experience to vocabulary
- Names the Four Pillars after HAP describes his own process
- Explains why computational thinking is necessary without giving prescriptions

Prof. Teeters’ role is explanatory but restrained. She does not test or instruct.

---

## Core Concept: Logic vs Computational Thinking

Station 4 establishes a clear distinction:

- **Logical thinking**: Determines whether something is true, false, correct, or incorrect
- **Computational thinking**: Determines how to approach, structure, communicate, and repeat problem-solving processes

The station emphasizes that computational thinking becomes essential when problems grow beyond what can be held in one person’s head.

---

## The Four Pillars of Computational Thinking

Prof. Teeters explains that many frameworks describe computational thinking using four core techniques. These are presented as **names for behaviors HAP has already demonstrated**, not as new skills to practice.

- **Decomposition**  
  Breaking a problem into smaller parts so each piece can be understood and worked on.

- **Pattern Recognition**  
  Looking for similarities or repeated behavior so solutions do not need to be reinvented.

- **Abstraction**  
  Focusing only on what matters and setting aside details that do not affect the outcome.

- **Algorithmic Thinking**  
  Describing steps clearly so a solution can be followed again and again.

No exercises or assessments are attached to these pillars in this station.

---

## Key Characteristics of Computational Thinking (High-Level)

Computational thinking is described as enabling problem-solving approaches that:

- Can be **carried out automatically**, without constant human judgment
- Can be **reused** across similar problems
- Can be **tested and refined** over time
- Can be applied beyond computer science, including science, data analysis, and creative fields

These characteristics are discussed narratively, not as a checklist.

---

## Station Boundary Rules

Station 4 explicitly does **not**:

- Introduce programming syntax
- Modify or extend the game
- Require students to apply the Four Pillars
- Teach optimization or performance
- Prepare code for implementation

The station is reflective and conceptual by design.

---

## Transition to Station 5

The station ends with HAP realizing that:

- The logic exists
- The reasoning behind it is undocumented
- If HAP steps away, understanding disappears

This insight motivates the next station:

> Learning how developers record and communicate their decisions so reasoning does not vanish.

---

## Design Success Criteria

Station 4 is successful if:

- Students can recognize the Four Pillars later and say, “Oh, we already did that.”
- The station feels clarifying rather than instructional
- No new technical anxiety is introduced
- The transition to documentation feels necessary, not arbitrary

---

## Summary

Station 4 names the thinking HAP has already practiced and explains why that thinking matters. It reframes earlier struggle as intentional development of a professional mindset and prepares students for documentation, collaboration, and future coding work.
