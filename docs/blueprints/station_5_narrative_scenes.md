# Station 5 Narrative Scenes

## Station 5: Learning by Example

---

### Scene 1: HAP’s Question

HAP pauses after everything it has learned so far.

> “I know how to think about problems now,” HAP says.  
> “I can reason through logic, describe steps, and recognize patterns.”

HAP looks back at its simple game.

> “But how do real developers make projects?”

It considers what it has seen before.

> “Sometimes they start from scratch.  
> Other times, they copy something that already exists and change it.”

HAP wonders how developers decide which path to take.

### Scene 2: Grace Introduces Learning by Example

Grace listens and nods.

> “Developers *can* learn by studying existing projects,” she says.  
> “And by adapting them thoughtfully.”

She explains that learning by example is not a shortcut.

> “It’s how developers see what works, what doesn’t, and why.”

Grace pauses, then adds:

> “If you want to understand a project someone else built, there’s one habit that matters more than all the others.”

She smiles.

> “Start by reading the README.”

### Scene 3: HAP Reads the Root README

HAP opens the Magic Quotes repository.

The first thing it sees is not code, but words.

HAP notices that the README explains:

- what the project is
- why it exists
- how people are expected to contribute

It realizes something important.

> “This project tells me how to think before it tells me what to write.”

---

### Scene 4: Discovering More Than One README

As HAP reads further, it notices a link in the contributing section.

It leads to another README, inside the `data` folder.

HAP pauses.

> “There are multiple README files.”

Each one explains something different, at the level where it matters.

HAP understands:

> “Developers don’t explain everything in one place.  
> They explain things where people will need them.”

---

### Scene 5: Learning from an Example File

Inside the data folder, HAP opens `example-quote.json`.

It does not try to change it.

It studies it.

HAP notices:

- the structure
- the repeated patterns
- the careful naming
- the consistency

> “I could copy this,” HAP thinks.  
> “And make something like it.”

Not to steal it exactly — but to understand it.

---

### Scene 6: Noticing the Role of AI

Back in the root README, HAP rereads a line it almost skipped:

> “AI-assisted content… with the expectation that humans will edit and curate the results.”

HAP pauses.

Prof. Teeters, observing, explains gently:

> “When the goal is good code, it matters less who thought of it first.  
> What matters is that you understand it, adapt it, and use it correctly.”

She adds:

> “Learning from examples, mentors, peers — even AI — can serve the same purpose when done thoughtfully.”

HAP understands.

AI is not replacing learning.  
It can support it.

---

### Scene 7: A Safe Place to Try

HAP looks again at the Magic Quotes project.

It sees:

- clear rules
- examples
- documentation
- room for new contributions

> “This project was designed to be safe,” HAP realizes.  
> “Safe to learn. Safe to try. Safe to make something and improve it.”

For the first time, HAP does not hesitate.

> “I think I could be a contributor.”

---

### Scene 8: Transition to Station 6

HAP knows what comes next.

It will not start from nothing.

It will:

- follow the examples
- respect the structure
- use AI carefully
- and create its own `quote-hap.json`

That work belongs in the next station.
