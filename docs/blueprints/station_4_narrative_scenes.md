# Station 4 Narrative — Scene-Based Description

**Station Title:** From Logic to Computational Thinking  
**Narrative Focus:** Naming the thinking HAP has already practiced

---

## Narrative Intent

Station 4 is a **story of realization, not instruction**.

HAP does not learn a new technique in this station. Instead, HAP comes to understand *what kind of thinking* has been guiding their actions all along, and why that thinking is necessary if they want to build beyond a single, simple game.

The station’s narrative goal is to move HAP (and observing students) from:

> “I fixed a game using logic.”  
> to  
> “I was practicing a way of thinking that developers rely on.”

## Scene 1: Ambition Beyond the Game

**Setting:** HAP reflecting on the completed Secret Number game

HAP observes that the game now behaves correctly. The logic is sound. The problem that once caused confusion has been resolved.

However, satisfaction is mixed with restlessness.

HAP admits to Grace that they do not want to stop here. They want to build a *real* game — the kind of game they experience on their roboPhone. Not this one puzzle, but something with more moving parts, more interaction, and more rules working together.

This scene establishes motivation without introducing complexity.

---

## Scene 2: Grace Sets the Boundary

**Setting:** Conversation between HAP and Grace

Grace listens carefully to HAP’s ambition. She does not discourage it, but she does not encourage haste either.

Grace draws a clear distinction:

- Logic helps decide whether something makes sense
- Logic alone is not enough to build larger, more involved systems

Grace introduces a single phrase — *computational thinking* — and nothing more.

She does not explain it. She does not define it. She simply names it as the kind of thinking HAP has been using and will need to continue using.

Grace directs HAP to Prof. Teeters to understand why this matters.

This scene creates curiosity, not clarity.

---

## Scene 3: Seeking Understanding

**Setting:** HAP approaches Prof. Teeters

HAP does not arrive confused about the game. HAP arrives curious about the *thinking* behind the game.

HAP asks what computational thinking is and why Grace believes it matters.

Prof. Teeters does not begin with definitions. Instead, she asks HAP to describe what they did when the game did not work.

HAP describes actions in their own words:

- breaking the game into smaller parts
- noticing repeated behavior
- focusing on what actually affected the outcome
- carefully walking through steps until the logic made sense

Prof. Teeters listens without interruption.

## Scene 4: Naming the Thinking

**Setting:** Continuation of the conversation

After HAP finishes describing their process, Prof. Teeters explains that many frameworks group this kind of problem-solving under a shared name: *computational thinking*.

She explains that this thinking is often described using four pillars:

- **Decomposition** — breaking a problem into smaller, manageable parts
- **Pattern Recognition** — identifying similarities and repeated behavior
- **Abstraction** — focusing on what matters and ignoring irrelevant details
- **Algorithmic Thinking** — describing steps clearly so they can be followed again and again

These are presented as **labels**, not lessons.

HAP recognizes each one as something already familiar.

## Scene 5: Why Computational Thinking Is Necessary

**Setting:** Reflective explanation by Prof. Teeters

Prof. Teeters explains that computational thinking is not about solving one problem.

It is about solving problems in a way that:

- can be carried out without constant human judgment
- can be reused when similar problems appear
- can be tested and refined over time
- applies beyond programming into many other fields

HAP realizes that logic alone answers questions of correctness, but computational thinking shapes the *approach* to problem solving.

---

## Scene 6: HAP’s Realization

**Setting:** Internal reflection

HAP articulates the insight clearly:

> I know my game is super simple and not the real world. If I want to build things that work beyond this game, I can’t just think logically. I need a way of thinking and communicating that stays effective even as what I’m building becomes more complex.

The focus shifts away from the game itself and toward the thinking behind it.

---

## Scene 7: Preparing for What Comes Next

**Setting:** Closing reflection

HAP notices that while the logic exists, the reasoning behind it is still undocumented.

If HAP steps away, the understanding disappears.

This realization leads naturally to the next station:

Learning how developers record decisions and reasoning so understanding does not vanish.

---

## Narrative Success Criteria

The Station 4 narrative is successful if:

- HAP’s growth feels earned, not explained
- Computational Thinking is recognized, not memorized
- Students understand *why* CT matters before being asked to apply it
- The transition to documentation feels necessary and natural

---

## Summary

Station 4’s narrative reframes earlier struggle as deliberate development of a professional way of thinking. It names computational thinking as the connective tissue between logic, communication, and future creation.
