# Station 5 Blueprint

## 1. Station identity

```
Station ID: station-5-learning-by-example
Title (student-facing): Learning by Example and Documentation
Lab context: Week 1 — Becoming a Developer (thinking and communicating before coding)
Prerequisites:
- Station 1: Thinking Logically (describing behavior)
- Station 2: Understanding Code Functionality (step-by-step logic)
- Station 3: Communicating Logic (pseudocode and flowcharts)
- Station 4: From Logic to Computational Thinking
```

---

## 2. Learning intent

```
Primary concept:
Developers learn and collaborate by reading, copying, adapting, and documenting existing work.

Supporting concepts:
- Documentation helps developers understand a project before changing it
- Markdown is the shared language developers use to explain intent and decisions
- Writing clarifies thinking for the original developer, not just others

Explicit non-goals:
- Teaching Git commands or workflows
- Explaining build tools or deployment steps
- Writing polished or production-ready documentation
- Teaching JSON syntax in depth
```

---

## 3. Narrative design

### Characters present

```
- [x] HAP (primary narrator)
- [x] Grace Hopper (introducing learning by example)
- [x] Prof. Teeters (one philosophical framing moment)
```

---

### HAP's arc

```
Starting state:
HAP understands logic, pseudocode, flowcharts, and computational thinking, but does not yet understand how developers learn from existing projects.

Key question:
How do developers learn to build real projects without starting from nothing each time?

Ending state:
HAP understands that reading documentation, studying examples, and adapting existing work are core developer practices.
```

---

## 4. Prof. Teeters moment

**Frequency:** Once

```
- [x] Mid-station philosophical framing

Her key line:
"When the goal is good code, it matters less who thought of it first. What matters is that you understand it, adapt it, and use it correctly."
```

---

## 5. Grace Hopper moments

```
- [x] Reframing learning as adaptation, not invention

Her key line:
"Developers can learn by studying existing projects and adapting them thoughtfully."
```

---

## 6. HAP's confessions

```
1. I believed copying someone else’s work meant I was not really learning.
2. I assumed documentation was written only after the real work was done.
3. I thought README files were instructions, not explanations of intent.
```

---

## 7. Code example contract

```
Primary role: [x] Illustrative

Constraints:
- Uses existing repository files as artifacts
- Highlights README.md, data/README.md, and example-quote.json
- Does not modify or execute code

Student interaction:
- What they should notice: how documentation and examples explain structure and expectations
- What they should NOT change: any project files
```

---

## 8. HAP pose selection

| Location | Pose intent | Cognitive state | Image filename |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Intro | curiosity | reflective, questioning | hap-thinking_qx9abc |
| Discovery | observation | focused, analytical | hap-looking-close_qp7f2 |
| Realization | confidence | calm understanding | hap-lightbulb_zy7kml |

---

## 9. Station flow skeleton

```
1. Asking how real developers build projects
2. Learning that developers can learn by example
3. Reading the root README to understand intent
4. Discovering multiple README files through links
5. Studying an example JSON file
6. Understanding AI-assisted creation as learning support
7. Recognizing the project as a safe place to contribute
8. Preparing to create quote-hap.json in Station 6
```

---

## 10. Scene framing

```
Previous station ended with:
Computational thinking identified as necessary for solving complex problems

This station opens with:
HAP wondering how developers actually build projects in practice

Connection point:
Documentation and examples as the bridge between thinking and contributing
```

---

## Pre-writing checklist

- [x] Primary concept stated in one sentence

- [x] Prof. Teeters appears once
- [x] Grace Hopper appears once with clear purpose
- [x] At least three specific confessions listed
- [x] Code role declared
- [x] Images justified
- [x] Flow skeleton complete
