# Station 5 Blueprint

## 1. Station identity

```
Station ID: station-5-documentation
Title (student-facing): Documenting Decisions and Logic
Lab context: Week 1 — Becoming a Developer (thinking and communicating before coding)
Prerequisites:
- Station 1: Thinking Logically (describing behavior)
- Station 2: Understanding Code Functionality (step-by-step logic)
- Station 3: Communicating Logic (pseudocode and flowcharts)
- Station 4: From Logic to Computational Thinking
```

---

## 2. Learning intent

```
Primary concept:
Documentation is how developers make their thinking visible, reusable, and durable beyond the moment they solved a problem.

Supporting concepts:
- Writing helps the developer detect gaps or flaws in reasoning before they become bugs
- Markdown is the shared, low-friction language developers use to explain decisions
- Documentation preserves context for future readers, including the original author

Explicit non-goals:
- Teaching prose writing or grammar
- Exhaustive Markdown syntax instruction
- Writing technical specifications
- Producing polished or final documentation
```

---

## 3. Narrative design

### Characters present

```
- [x] HAP (primary narrator)
- [x] Prof. Teeters (one guidance moment)
- [ ] Grace Hopper
```

---

### HAP's arc

```
Starting state:
HAP understands logic, pseudocode, flowcharts, and computational thinking, but has not yet considered how developers preserve and communicate their reasoning.

Key question:
How do developers make their thinking understandable and useful beyond their own head?

Ending state:
HAP understands documentation as a continuation of thinking, and Markdown as the common language developers use to record decisions, reasoning, and context.
```

---

## 4. Prof. Teeters moment

**Frequency:** Once

```
- [x] Mid-station perspective shift

Her key line:
"Code shows what happens. Documentation explains why it was done this way."
```

---

## 5. Grace Hopper moments

```
- [ ] Terminology correction
- [ ] Technical precision
- [ ] Reframing question
```

Grace does not appear in this station.

---

## 6. HAP's confessions

List specific, concrete mistakes HAP made:

```
1. I assumed documentation was something added after the real work was finished.
2. I tried to remember my reasoning instead of writing it down and later could not explain why I made certain choices.
3. I believed comments and README files were mainly for other people, not for me.
```

---

## 7. Code example contract

```
Primary role: [x] Illustrative

Constraints:
- May include small Markdown snippets
- May reference existing pseudocode and flowcharts
- Must not introduce new logic or code

Student interaction:
- What they should notice: how writing clarifies thinking
- What they should NOT change: the game logic itself
```

---

## 8. HAP pose selection

| Location | Pose intent | Cognitive state | Image filename |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Intro | reflective | curious, observant | hap-thinking_qx9abc |
| Confession | showing mistakes | embarrassed but learning | hap-broke-things_qtbum4 |
| Breakthrough | realization | calm confidence | hap-lightbulb_zy7kml |

---

## 9. Station flow skeleton

```
1. Looking at real developer projects — noticing README files
2. Realizing Markdown as a shared developer language
3. Writing reveals gaps in thinking
4. Documentation as memory and context
5. Connecting logic, CT, pseudocode, and flowcharts
6. Quick Reference — why developers document
```

---

## 10. Scene framing

```
Previous station ended with:
Computational thinking named and understood as necessary for complex problem-solving

This station opens with:
HAP noticing how developers communicate around their code

Connection point:
Documentation as the next natural step in becoming a developer
```

---

## Pre-writing checklist

- [x] Primary concept stated in one sentence
- [x] Non-goals explicit
- [x] HAP's arc clearly defined
- [x] Prof. Teeters appears once
- [x] Grace does not appear unnecessarily
- [x] At least two specific confessions listed
- [x] Code role declared
- [x] Images justified
- [x] Flow skeleton complete
