# Station 2 Blueprint — Communicating Logic

**HAP Learning Lab: Computational Thinking**

This blueprint defines *Station 2* before any prose is written. It follows the official station blueprint template and incorporates the Station Blueprint Improvement Guide. It is intentionally aligned with the completed Station 1 blueprint and the Secret Number Game artifact.

---

## 1. Station identity

```text
Station ID: station-2-communicating-logic
Title (student-facing): Communicating Logic
Subtitle: Turning ideas into shared representations
Lab context: Second station in Week 1: Becoming a Developer
Prerequisites: Station 1 — Thinking Logically
```

---

## 2. Learning intent

```text
Primary concept:
Logic must be written down in shared representations so it can be understood, reviewed, and improved.

Supporting concepts:
- The same logic can be represented in more than one way
- Representations make thinking visible

Explicit non-goals:
- Writing JavaScript
- Learning full algorithm design
- Optimizing logic
- Debugging or testing logic
```

**Focus rule:** This station is about *representation*, not correctness or implementation.

---

## 3. Narrative design

### Characters present

```text
- [x] HAP (narrator)
- [ ] Prof. Teeters (not required)
- [ ] Grace Hopper (not required)
```

### HAP’s arc

```text
Starting state:
HAP can describe what should happen, but keeps everything in their head.

Key question:
"How do I make my logic clear to someone else?"

Ending state:
HAP understands that logic should be externalized using shared formats like pseudocode and flowcharts.
```

Confidence level at end: **Understands how to express logic, not yet how to evaluate it.**

---

## 4. Prof. Teeters moments

**Frequency:** Zero (intentional)

```text
- [ ] Opening perspective shift
- [ ] Mid-station guidance
- [ ] Validation of learning
```

**Rationale:** This station emphasizes peer-level communication tools rather than instructor guidance.

---

## 5. Grace Hopper moments

```text
- [ ] Terminology correction
- [ ] Technical precision
- [ ] Reframing question
```

**Rationale:** Precision and terminology are deferred to later stations.

---

## 6. HAP’s confessions

```text
1. I explained my game idea out loud, but when someone else tried to follow it,
   they interpreted it completely differently.

2. I thought my logic was "obvious"—until I tried to write it down and realized
   I was skipping steps without noticing. 😳

3. I changed my explanation depending on who I was talking to, which meant
   my logic was never actually consistent.
```

Each confession highlights a concrete consequence: misunderstanding, hidden gaps, or inconsistency.

---

## 7. Code example contract

```text
Primary role: Illustrative

Constraints:
- Must use pseudocode (Level 1) and simple flowcharts only
- Must not include real programming syntax
- Must not introduce new game rules

Student interaction:
- What they should notice: the same logic can appear in multiple representations
- What they should NOT change: the behavior of the Secret Number Game
```

**Reference:** Canonical game behavior is defined in `docs/blueprints/secret_number_game_artifact.md`.

This station applies the **representation lens** to the game.

## 8. HAP pose selection

| Location | Pose intent | Cognitive state | Image filename |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Intro | focused, ready to explain | thinking outward | hap-laptop_xiewar |
| Confession | realizing gaps | uneasy, reflective | hap-confused-map_q8q0ej |
| Breakthrough | clarity through structure | confident sharing | hap-thumbs-up_s4si0j |

All filenames verified against the approved inventory.

---

## 9. Station flow skeleton

```text
1. Opening scene — HAP realizes explanations change depending on the listener
2. Core idea — logic must be written down to be shared
3. Representation concept — text vs visuals
4. Application — Secret Number Game in pseudocode and flowchart form
5. Confession — gaps revealed when logic is externalized
6. Breakthrough — clarity through shared representations
7. Quick reference — key ideas to remember
```

---

## 10. Scene framing

```text
Previous station ended with:
Behavior must be described clearly before code.

This station opens with:
HAP trying to explain their logic to someone else—and struggling.

Connection point:
Station 2 builds on behavior-first thinking by introducing shared representations of logic.
```

## Additional content decisions

```text
SEO description:
Learn why developers write logic down using pseudocode and flowcharts before coding.

Insight cards:
1. "Logic Is Invisible Until You Write It"
2. "Same Idea, Different Representations"
3. "Clarity Enables Collaboration"

Insight stats:
1. Think → Write → Then Code
2. Text or Visual, Same Logic
3. Unwritten Logic Breaks

Footer reminder:
Write it down so others can follow.
```

## Pre-writing checklist

Before writing Station 2 content:

- [x] Primary concept is one sentence
- [x] Non-goals are explicit
- [x] HAP’s arc has clear start and end
- [x] Prof. Teeters does not appear
- [x] Grace Hopper does not appear
- [x] At least two confessions with consequences
- [x] Code role declared (illustrative)
- [x] Image filenames verified
- [x] Flow skeleton complete
- [x] Secret Number Game reference documented
