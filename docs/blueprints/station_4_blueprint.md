# Station 4 Blueprint

## Station Identity

**Station ID:** station-4-computational-thinking  
**Title (student-facing):** From Logic to Computational Thinking  
**Lab context:** Week 1 — Becoming a Developer (Thinking before coding)  
**Prerequisites:**
- Station 1: Thinking Logically (behavior before code)
- Station 2: Understanding Code Functionality (step-by-step logic)
- Station 3: Communicating Logic (pseudocode and flowcharts)

---

## Learning Intent

**Primary concept (one sentence):**  
Computational thinking is a way of thinking and communicating that goes beyond logical correctness and allows developers to approach increasingly complex problems without their reasoning breaking down.

**Supporting concepts:**
- Logic determines whether something is correct; computational thinking determines how to approach problems
- Developers often practice computational thinking before they know its name
- Shared language helps developers recognize and reuse effective thinking patterns

**Explicit non-goals:**
- Teaching programming syntax
- Modifying or extending the Secret Number game
- Practicing the Four Pillars through exercises
- Optimization, performance, or refactoring

---

## Narrative Design

### Characters Present

- [x] HAP (primary narrator)
- [x] Grace Hopper (terminology introduction)
- [x] Prof. Teeters (conceptual framing)


### HAP’s Arc

**Starting state:**  
HAP is satisfied that the game works but feels limited by what logic alone can accomplish.

**Key question:**  
What kind of thinking is required to build things beyond this simple game?

**Ending state:**  
HAP understands that computational thinking explains the approach he has already been using and why it is necessary for more complex work.

---

## Grace Hopper Moment

**Purpose:** Naming the concept without explanation

- Grace introduces the term *computational thinking*
- She explicitly distinguishes logic from what will be required next
- She does not define or enumerate

**Key line:**  
“Logic helps you decide whether something makes sense. But logic by itself will not carry you very far.”

---

## Prof. Teeters Moment

**Purpose:** Framing and naming the thinking HAP has already practiced

- Occurs once in the station
- Prof. Teeters listens first, then names patterns
- She introduces shared vocabulary after experience

**Key line:**  
“You were not just fixing a game. You were practicing how developers think.”

---

## Core Concept Framing

Station 4 establishes:

- **Logical thinking**: concerned with correctness and consistency
- **Computational thinking**: concerned with approach, structure, communication, and repeatability

Computational thinking is framed as necessary when problems can no longer be held entirely in one person’s head.

---

## The Four Pillars of Computational Thinking

The Four Pillars are introduced as names for behaviors HAP has already demonstrated:

- **Decomposition**  
  Breaking a problem into smaller parts so each piece can be understood and worked on.

- **Pattern Recognition**  
  Identifying repeated behavior so solutions do not need to be reinvented.

- **Abstraction**  
  Focusing on what matters and setting aside details that do not affect the outcome.

- **Algorithmic Thinking**  
  Describing steps clearly so a solution can be followed again and again.

No application or assessment is required in this station.

---

## Key Characteristics (High-Level Only)

Computational thinking enables approaches that:

- Can be automated
- Can be reused across similar problems
- Can be tested and refined over time
- Apply beyond programming to many disciplines

These characteristics are discussed narratively, not operationally.

---

## Code and Artifact Policy

**Code examples:** None required  
**Artifacts produced:** None  
**Student interaction:** Observational and reflective only

Station 4 intentionally produces no new technical artifacts.

---

## Station Flow Skeleton

1. HAP expresses ambition to build real games
2. Grace introduces computational thinking as a requirement
3. Prof. Teeters reframes HAP’s prior work
4. Four Pillars are named and described
5. HAP articulates the difference between logic and CT
6. Transition to documentation as the next necessary skill

---

## Transition Framing

**Previous station ended with:**  
Clear communication of logic using pseudocode and flowcharts

**This station opens with:**  
HAP’s desire to build beyond the current example

**This station ends with:**  
HAP realizing that reasoning must be recorded to persist

This sets up Station 5: Documenting Decisions and Logic.

---

## Design Success Criteria

Station 4 is successful if:

- Students recognize the Four Pillars later and say “we already did that”
- The station feels clarifying, not instructional
- No new technical anxiety is introduced
- The motivation for documentation feels natural and necessary

---

## Summary

Station 4 names the thinking HAP has already practiced, explains why it matters, and prepares students to preserve and communicate their reasoning in the next station.
