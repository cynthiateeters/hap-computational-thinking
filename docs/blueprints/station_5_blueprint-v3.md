# Station 5 blueprint

## 1. Station identity

```
Station ID: station-5-learning-by-example
Title (student-facing): Learning by Example and Documentation
Lab context: Week 1 — Becoming a Developer (thinking and communicating before coding)
Prerequisites:
- Station 1: Thinking Logically (describing behavior)
- Station 2: Understanding Code Functionality (step-by-step logic)
- Station 3: Communicating Logic (pseudocode and flowcharts)
- Station 4: From Logic to Computational Thinking
```

---

## 2. Learning intent

```
Primary concept:
Developers learn and collaborate by reading, copying, adapting, and documenting existing work.

Supporting concepts:
- Documentation helps developers understand a project before changing it
- Markdown is the shared language developers use to explain intent and decisions
- Writing clarifies thinking for the original developer, not just others

Explicit non-goals:
- Teaching Git commands or workflows
- Explaining build tools or deployment steps
- Writing polished or production-ready documentation
- Teaching JSON syntax in depth
```

---

## 3. Central learning artifacts

```
GitHub repository:
https://github.com/cynthiateeters/magic-quotes

Live site:
https://magic-quotes.netlify.app/

Project type:
A beginner-friendly repository designed for learning by example and intentionally structured for safe contribution.

Why these artifacts matter:
- The repo and site are real, not examples
- Documentation explains how to participate
- Structure is intentional
- Designed as a safe learning project for new contributors
```

---

## 4. Narrative design

### Characters present

```
- [x] HAP (primary narrator)
- [x] Grace Hopper (introducing learning by example)
- [x] Prof. Teeters (one philosophical framing moment)
```

---

### HAP's arc

```
Starting state:
HAP understands logic, pseudocode, flowcharts, and computational thinking, but does not yet understand how developers learn from existing projects.

Key question:
How do developers learn to build real projects without starting from nothing each time?

Ending state:
HAP understands that reading documentation, studying examples, and adapting existing work are core developer practices. HAP feels ready to contribute to Magic Quotes.
```

---

## 5. Prof. Teeters moment

**Frequency:** Once

```
- [x] Late-station philosophical framing (Scene 6)

Her key line:
"When the goal is good code, it matters less who thought of it first. What matters is that you understand it, adapt it, and use it correctly."

Context: Appears after HAP reads about AI-assisted content in the Magic Quotes README.
```

---

## 6. Grace Hopper moments

**Frequency:** One scene with two key framings

```
- [x] Scene 2: Reframing learning as adaptation, not invention
- [x] Scene 2: Emphasizing the importance of reading documentation first

Her key lines:
1. "Developers can learn by studying existing projects and adapting them thoughtfully."
2. "Start by reading the README."
```

---

## 7. HAP's confessions

```
1. I believed copying someone else's work meant I was not really learning.
2. I thought README files were instructions, not explanations of intent.
```

---

## 8. Code example contract

```
Primary role: [x] Illustrative

Central project:
Magic Quotes (https://github.com/cynthiateeters/magic-quotes)

Files explicitly referenced:
- README.md (root level — project intent and contribution guidelines)
- data/README.md (nested documentation — specific folder context)
- data/example-quote.json (structural example — pattern to study)

Relationship between repo and site:
- The GitHub repo and the Netlify site represent the same project
- Documentation supports something that exists and runs
- Reading the repo explains how the site came to be

Constraints:
- Uses existing repository files as artifacts
- Highlights how documentation and examples explain structure and expectations
- Does not modify or execute code
- Does not become a GitHub tutorial
- Does not explain JSON syntax in depth

Student interaction:
- What they should notice: documentation hierarchy, structural patterns, contribution guidelines
- What they should NOT change: any project files (observation only)

Learning-by-example loop (visible but not named):
Read documentation → Study examples → Understand structure → Feel safe contributing → Prepare to add data
```

---

## 9. HAP pose selection

| Location    | Pose intent | Cognitive state         | Image filename                        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Intro       | curiosity   | reflective, questioning | [IMAGE TBD: verify against inventory] |
| Discovery   | observation | focused, analytical     | [IMAGE TBD: verify against inventory] |
| Realization | confidence  | calm understanding      | [IMAGE TBD: verify against inventory] |

**Note:** Image filenames MUST be verified against `skills/hap-image-validation/hap-cloudinary-complete-inventory.md` before content creation.

---

## 10. Station flow skeleton

```
1. Asking how real developers build projects (uncertainty, questioning)
2. Learning that developers can learn by example (opening, permission)
3. Reading the root README to understand Magic Quotes intent (discovery, structure)
4. Discovering multiple README files through links (pattern recognition)
5. Studying example-quote.json as a structural pattern (careful analysis)
6. Understanding AI-assisted creation as learning support (reframing)
7. Recognizing Magic Quotes as a safe place to contribute (confidence)
8. Preparing to create quote-hap.json in Station 6 (readiness, transition)
```

---

## 11. Scene framing

```
Previous station ended with:
Computational thinking identified as necessary for solving complex problems

This station opens with:
HAP wondering how developers actually build projects in practice

Connection point:
Documentation and examples as the bridge between thinking and contributing

Central artifact visibility:
Students must clearly see that Magic Quotes repo is real, the site is real, the documentation explains how to participate, and the structure is intentional.
```

---

## 12. Success criteria

The station is successful when:

- A reader can click the repo link and recognize everything HAP notices
- A reader can visit the live site and understand why documentation matters
- Station 6's task (creating `quote-hap.json`) feels like a natural next step
- The Magic Quotes project feels intentionally chosen, not incidental
- The learning-by-example loop is visible without being named as a "process"

---
