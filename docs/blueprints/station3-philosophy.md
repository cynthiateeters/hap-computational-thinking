Station 3: Reasoning and Correcting Logic

Station 3 should:

Identify the flaw in secret-number-simple-loop.pseudo

Explain why it fails (infinite loop due to unchanged state)

Walk through how the logic must change conceptually

Produce a corrected pseudocode version - docs/examples/secret-number-simple-loop-fixed.pseudo

Still remain pre-code

This means:

✔ Fixing logic is allowed
