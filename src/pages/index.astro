    <p><strong>Welcome to my Computational Thinking Learning Lab!</strong> I'm HAP, Prof. Teeters' apprentice, and I'm so glad you're here.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">When I first tried to learn coding, I made every mistake possible. I jumped straight into typing code before thinking about what should happen. I wrote logic that looked correct but trapped players in infinite loops. I trusted AI output without verification.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters taught me that becoming a developer isn't about memorizing syntax—it's about learning to think computationally. These six stations are my learning journey, and now I get to share it with you.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Let me show you what I discovered about thinking like a developer... 🟠</p>

                    <h3>🔬 What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>Computational thinking is a way of approaching problems that goes beyond just writing correct code. It's about breaking things down, recognizing patterns, focusing on what matters, and describing steps clearly.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters taught me that these skills apply everywhere—not just in programming.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-point">
                    <h3>🎯 How I Practiced</h3>
                    <p>I built the Secret Number Game from the ground up—first describing behavior in plain language, then writing pseudocode, then finding and fixing a hidden bug through tracing.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Then I practiced real developer workflows by contributing to a live project called Magic Quotes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-point">
                    <h3>🎨 My Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Mistakes are data, not failures. Every bug I found taught me something. Every time I got confused, I discovered a gap in my understanding.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">I share my mistakes openly because that's how we actually learn.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-point">
                    <h3>🤔 My Advice</h3>
                    <p>Take your time at each station. Don't rush to the code—the thinking comes first. When something doesn't make sense, trace through it step by step.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">And remember: if you can't explain it in plain words, you're not ready to code it.</p>

                        <p class="station-description">I used to think coding was about typing fast. Prof. Teeters taught me that the real skill is thinking clearly about what should happen—before you write anything.

                        <p class="station-description">I tried explaining my game idea to Grace and realized I kept changing the explanation. Logic that only exists in your head can't be reviewed or improved. Here I learn to write my thinking down so others can follow it.</p>

                        <p class="station-description">My loop looked correct when I read it. But when Prof. Teeters asked me to trace through it step by step, I discovered the player was trapped in an infinite loop! Here I learn that reading is not the same as tracing.</p>

                        <p class="station-description">After fixing my game, I wanted to build bigger things. Grace told me logic alone wasn't enough. That's when I learned the Four Pillars of Computational Thinking—and realized I had been using them all along without knowing their names.</p>

                        <p class="station-description">I knew how to think about problems, but what does it actually feel like to work with real developer tools? Here I fork Magic Quotes, clone it locally, and learn to validate my setup—all without memorizing terminal commands.</p>

                        <p class="station-description">I asked AI to generate my contribution and everything failed validation. Prof. Teeters taught me: AI can generate code faster than you can type, but you own every line. Here I learn to prompt effectively, verify always, and understand everything.</p>
