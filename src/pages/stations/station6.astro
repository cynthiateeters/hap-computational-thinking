    <p><strong>Welcome to Station 6!</strong> After setting up Magic Quotes locally, I was ready to create my contribution. I needed developer wisdom quotes about computational thinking—and I thought: "AI could help me generate these in seconds!"</p>
    <p class="mt-1">I asked an AI assistant to generate quotes, copied the output immediately, and ran <code>npm run validate</code>. Everything failed. The AI had used wrong category names, duplicate IDs, and quotes that had nothing to do with computational thinking.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters sat me down: "HAP, AI can generate code faster than you can type, but it doesn't understand your project's requirements unless you explain them. You own every line of code, whether you wrote it or AI did."</p>
    <p class="mt-1">That lesson changed how I work with AI completely. Let me show you what I learned about using AI responsibly—the prompts that work, the verification that's mandatory, and the rules that ensure quality! 🟠</p>

        <h3><span class='insight-icon'>⚡</span> Speed with Responsibility</h3>
        <p class='stat-large'>Fast ≠ Good</p>
        <p><strong>AI generates code in seconds, but verification takes you minutes.</strong></p>
        <p>I asked AI to generate quotes without any requirements. It produced generic motivational quotes in 3 seconds. None of them matched Magic Quotes' schema or theme. I spent 15 minutes debugging. When I provided detailed requirements upfront (schema fields, category, tone, theme), AI generated exactly what I needed in 5 seconds—and validation passed immediately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='insight-card'>
        <h3><span class='insight-icon'>🎯</span> Detailed Prompts = Quality</h3>
        <p class='stat-large stat-teal'>Specific > Vague</p>
        <p><strong>Vague prompts produce vague results. Detailed prompts produce professional code.</strong></p>
        <p>"Generate quotes" gave me useless output. "Generate 5 computational-thinking quotes, category 'developer-wisdom', tone 'reflective', 10-20 words each, following schema with fields id/category/tone/text/source" gave me production-ready JSON. Prof. Teeters taught me: the quality of AI output depends entirely on the quality of your prompt.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='insight-card'>
        <h3><span class='insight-icon'>✅</span> You Own Every Line</h3>
        <p class='stat-large stat-brown'>AI Assists, You Decide</p>
        <p><strong>Whether you typed it or AI generated it, you're responsible for correctness.</strong></p>
        <p>I copied AI output without understanding it. When Prof. Teeters asked why I chose those specific quotes, I couldn't explain. She reminded me: "Speed without understanding is technical debt. If you can't explain what the code does, you don't own it yet." Now I verify, test, and understand before committing anything.</p>

        <h3>HAP's Confession: I Shipped AI Code Without Verification</h3>
        <p>I was so excited about AI's speed that I asked my AI assistant to generate my quote-hap.json file, copied the entire output, and immediately committed it to Git. I thought: "This looks right! AI must know what it's doing!"</p>
        <p class='mt-1'>When I ran <code>npm run validate</code>, everything failed. AI had invented category names that didn't exist in the schema ("inspiration" instead of "developer-wisdom"). It used duplicate IDs. The quotes were generic motivational sayings, not computational thinking wisdom. I had to delete everything and start over.</p>
        <p class='mt-1'>Prof. Teeters' lesson stuck with me: "AI doesn't know your project's rules unless you explicitly provide them. Always verify. Always understand. You own the code—the responsibility doesn't transfer to the AI." Now I treat AI output like a first draft, not the final answer.</p>

      <h2>What AI Can and Can't Do for Computational Thinking</h2>
      <p class='mb-2'>When I first discovered AI coding assistants, I thought they were magic—tools that could write perfect code instantly. Whether you use GitHub Copilot in VS Code, ChatGPT, Claude, or another AI assistant, the principles are the same. Prof. Teeters helped me understand what AI actually excels at and where it struggles. Understanding these boundaries is critical for responsible use.</p>

            <li><strong>Following explicit rules:</strong> When you provide schema requirements clearly, AI follows them precisely</li>
            <li><strong>Handling repetition:</strong> AI never gets bored creating similar entries with consistent formatting</li>

          <h3>AI Struggles With</h3>

            <li><strong>Validation:</strong> AI generates code but doesn't run <code>npm run validate</code> to test it</li>
            <li><strong>Learning intent:</strong> AI optimizes for speed, not for helping YOU understand what it generated</li>

          <h3>HAP's Takeaway: AI as Pattern Matcher, Not Thinker</h3>
          <p>AI was excellent at generating valid JSON syntax once I showed it the schema. It never made typos, always closed brackets correctly, and formatted everything beautifully. That's pattern recognition—AI has seen millions of JSON files and knows the structure cold.</p>
          <p class='mt-1'>But AI failed completely at understanding WHICH quotes mattered for computational thinking. It gave me motivational sayings like "Believe in yourself!" because it had seen similar quotes in other datasets. It didn't understand the difference between generic inspiration and developer wisdom about problem-solving.</p>
          <p class='mt-1'>That's when I realized: AI is a pattern matcher, not a thinker. It excels at structure and syntax. It struggles with meaning and judgment. My job is to provide the judgment (what makes a good computational thinking quote), and AI handles the structure (correct JSON format). Together, we're faster—but only if I stay in control.</p>

      <h2>Generating Developer Wisdom Quotes with AI</h2>
      <p class='mb-2'>My first task was creating quotes for quote-hap.json. I knew Magic Quotes needed developer wisdom about computational thinking, but I didn't understand yet how to communicate that effectively to AI. My early prompts were disasters because I assumed AI understood context it didn't have.</p>

      <h3 class='mt-3'>Before I Learned to Write Good Prompts</h3>
      <p class='mt-1'>I typed a vague, one-sentence request into GitHub Copilot. I thought being brief was efficient. I was wrong—vague prompts waste time because you have to regenerate everything.</p>

          <li><strong>Generic, off-theme quotes</strong> — These are motivational sayings, not computational thinking wisdom</li>

  <section class='content-section'>
    <h2>Try It Yourself: Create Your Own json File</h2>
    <p class='mt-1'>Now it's your turn. You've seen how I use AI to generate schema-compliant quotes. Let's walk through creating your own quote file for Magic Quotes using everything you've learned about responsible AI prompting.</p>

    <div class='intro-box mt-2'>
      <p><strong>Your Challenge:</strong> Create a file called <code>quote-yourname.json</code> in the <code>data/</code> folder with developer wisdom quotes about your learning journey through Stations 1-5.</p>
      <h4 class='mt-2'>Requirements:</h4>
      <ul class='mt-1'>
        <li><strong>Schema compliance:</strong> All required fields (author, about, entries with id/category/tone/text/source)</li>
        <li><strong>Quote count:</strong> 3-5 quotes minimum</li>
        <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Computational thinking lessons from Stations 1-5</li>
        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Specific, actionable, 10-20 words each</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Must pass <code>npm run validate</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class='mt-2'>Your Workflow (5 Steps):</h4>
      <ol class='mt-1'>
        <li><strong>Craft your prompt</strong> with schema + quality constraints (use my examples as templates)</li>

      <h2 class='section-heading-centered'>HAP's Rules for Working with AI</h2>
      <p class='mb-2'>After creating quote-hap.json with AI assistance, I've developed six non-negotiable rules. These aren't suggestions—they're requirements that Prof. Teeters validated. Follow them every time you use AI for coding tasks.</p>

      <div class='tip-card'>
        <div class='tip-number'>1</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Always Specify Schema Requirements First</h3>
          <p>AI doesn't know your project's rules unless you provide them. Start EVERY prompt by pasting your schema or listing required fields. Don't assume AI remembers context from earlier. Schema compliance isn't optional—it's foundational. Without it, AI generates plausible-looking code that fails validation every time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class='tip-card'>
        <div class='tip-number'>2</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Detailed Prompts Get Professional Results</h3>
          <p>"Generate quotes" produces junk. "Generate 5 reflective developer-wisdom quotes, 10-20 words each, category 'developer-wisdom', following exact schema with fields id/category/tone/text/source, focused on computational thinking concepts from Stations 1-5" produces quality. The length of your prompt correlates directly with the quality of AI output.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class='tip-card'>
        <div class='tip-number'>3</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Verify Everything Before Committing</h3>
          <p>Run <code>npm run validate</code> before Git operations. Test manually even if validation passes. Read the output—don't just trust that it looks right. If you can't explain what the code does or why it's correct, you don't own it yet. Verification catches AI hallucinations, schema violations, and logical errors that look syntactically perfect.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class='tip-card'>
        <div class='tip-number'>4</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Understanding Beats Speed</h3>
          <p>AI can generate code faster than you can type, but speed without comprehension is technical debt. Read every line AI produces. Understand WHY it made each choice. Learn from the patterns. If Prof. Teeters asked you to explain this code, could you? If not, slow down and study it before accepting it.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class='tip-card'>
        <div class='tip-number'>5</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Quality Requires Explicit Constraints</h3>
          <p>AI won't optimize quality unless you define it. Include quality constraints in prompts: "concise" (10-20 words), "specific" (reference actual practices), "actionable" (something learners can do), "plain language" (no jargon). Generic prompts produce generic output. Professional prompts produce professional code.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class='tip-card'>
        <div class='tip-number'>6</div>
        <div>
          <h3>You Own Every Line of Code</h3>
          <p>Whether you typed it or AI generated it, you're responsible for quality, correctness, and schema compliance. Blame doesn't transfer to the AI when validation fails. Your name goes on the commit message. Own the code by verifying it, understanding it, and being willing to explain every decision it represents.</p>

         ============================================================ -->
  <section class='content-section'>
    <div class='topic-section'>
      <h2>Using VS Code Source Control for Your First Commit</h2>
      <p class='mb-2'>After creating quote-hap.json with AI and verifying it passed validation, I needed to commit my work to Git and push it to GitHub. Prof. Teeters showed me how to use VS Code's Source Control panel—no terminal commands needed.</p>

      <h3 class='mt-3'>Step 1: Open Source Control Panel</h3>
      <p class='mt-1'>In VS Code's sidebar, I clicked the Source Control icon (looks like a branching tree). This panel shows all files that changed since my last commit. I saw <code>data/quote-hap.json</code> listed with a "U" (untracked file).</p>

      <h3 class='mt-3'>Step 2: Stage Your Changes</h3>
      <p class='mt-1'>I clicked the <strong>+</strong> button next to <code>quote-hap.json</code> to stage it. Staging means "include this file in my next commit." The file moved from "Changes" to "Staged Changes"—ready to be committed.</p>

      <h3 class='mt-3'>Step 3: Write a Commit Message</h3>
      <p class='mt-1'>At the top of the Source Control panel, there's a text box for commit messages. I typed:</p>

      <CodeBlock
        code={`Add HAP's computational thinking quotes

Created quote-hap.json with 8 developer wisdom quotes about
lessons from Stations 1-5. All quotes generated with AI assistance,
verified for schema compliance, and validated with npm run validate.`}
        lang='text'
      />

      <p class='mt-1'><strong>Good commit messages explain WHAT changed and WHY.</strong> Not just "added file" but what the file contains and how you created it.</p>

      <h3 class='mt-3'>Step 4: Commit Your Changes</h3>
      <p class='mt-1'>I clicked the <strong>✓ Commit</strong> button. VS Code saved my changes to Git's history locally. Now my commit exists on my computer, but GitHub doesn't know about it yet.</p>

      <h3 class='mt-3'>Step 5: Push to GitHub</h3>
      <p class='mt-1'>At the bottom of the Source Control panel, I clicked <strong>Sync Changes</strong> (or the cloud upload icon). This pushed my local commit to my fork on GitHub. Now my contribution is visible online.</p>

      <div class='hap-note-callout mt-2'>
        <div class='hap-note-content'>
          <h3>🟠 What I learned about Git workflow:</h3>
          <p>Stage → Commit → Push is the pattern. VS Code's GUI makes it visual: you SEE which files changed, you CHOOSE which to include, you DESCRIBE what you did, then you SYNC to GitHub. No memorizing terminal commands. The Source Control panel shows your workflow state at every step.</p>

          <h3>🟠 HAP's First Contribution Moment</h3>
          <p>Seeing my PR appear on GitHub felt incredible. I'd gone from thinking computationally (Stations 1-4) to setting up a project (Station 5) to making a real contribution (Station 6). This wasn't a tutorial exercise—it was a live website that other people use. My quotes would appear on magic-quotes.netlify.app if the PR got merged.</p>
          <p class='mt-1'>Prof. Teeters told me: "This is how developers grow. You contribute small pieces to real projects. You learn from code review. You build confidence through practice." That's what Week 1 taught me—not just how to think, but how to participate.</p>

    <div class='topic-section'>
      <h2>When NOT to Use AI</h2>
      <p class='mb-2'>AI is powerful for generating code, but it's not always the right tool. Understanding when to work manually is just as important as knowing when to use AI. Prof. Teeters taught me these three scenarios where manual work beats AI speed.</p>

      <div class='analysis-grid mt-2'>
        <div class='analysis-point'>
          <h3>When You're Learning New Concepts</h3>
          <p><strong>Manual work builds understanding.</strong> If this is your first time working with JSON schemas, Git workflows, or project structures, type the code yourself. AI generates correct output but skips the learning process. You learn by doing, by making mistakes, by debugging your own errors. Use AI after you understand the fundamentals, not before.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='analysis-point'>
          <h3>When the Task Requires Judgment</h3>
          <p><strong>AI can't make quality decisions for you.</strong> Choosing WHICH computational thinking lessons matter most, WHICH quotes represent your learning journey, WHICH tone fits your voice—these are judgment calls. AI generates plausible options, but you decide what's good. Don't outsource the thinking that makes your work meaningful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='analysis-point'>
          <h3>When Verification Takes Longer Than Writing</h3>
          <p><strong>Sometimes manual is faster.</strong> For simple tasks (creating one quote, fixing a typo, adjusting a field), typing it yourself takes 30 seconds. Crafting a detailed AI prompt, reviewing output, and verifying correctness takes 2 minutes. Use AI for repetitive tasks (generating 10 similar quotes), not one-off edits.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class='warning-box mt-3'>
        <h3>🟠 Prof. Teeters' Warning About AI and Learning</h3>
        <p class='mt-1'><strong>"AI should accelerate what you already understand, not replace the learning process. If you use AI before you understand the problem, you're accepting solutions instead of developing judgment."</strong></p>
        <p class='mt-1'>She told me this after I tried to use AI other purposes—before I understood computational thinking. The AI-generated answers were correct, but I didn't learn anything. I had to go back and work through problems manually to build real understanding.</p>
